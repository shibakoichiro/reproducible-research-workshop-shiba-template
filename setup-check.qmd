## Instructions

1. Replace `"YOUR NAME"` above with your actual name
2. Render this document (Ctrl+Shift+K or Cmd+Shift+K)
3. If successful, commit and push this file (the rendered output is ignored by Git)

## Environment Check

The code below verifies that your R packages are installed correctly.

```{r}
#| label: package-check
#| message: false

# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
library(gt)
library(here)
library(NHANES)
```

If the above runs without errors, your packages are correctly installed.

## Quick Test

```{r}
#| label: tbl-test
#| tbl-cap: "Baseline characteristics of NHANES participants"

NHANES |>
  select(Age, Gender, BMI, BPSysAve) |>
  head(100) |>
  tbl_summary(
    by = Gender,
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})"),
    missing = "no"
  )
```

## Session Info

```{r}
#| label: session-info

sessionInfo()
```
